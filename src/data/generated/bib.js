        "abstract": "Abstract This study aimed to predict the drying kinetics, energy utilization (Eu), energy utilization ratio (EUR), exergy loss, and exergy efficiency of quince slice in a hot air (HA) dryer using artificial neural networks and ANFIS. The experiments were performed at air temperatures of 50, 60, and 70\u00b0C and air velocities of 0.6, 1.2, and 1.8\u00a0m/s. The thermal parameters were determined using thermodynamic relations. Increasing air temperature and air velocity increased the effective moisture diffusivity (Deff), Eu, EUR, exergy efficiency, and exergy loss. The value of the Deff was varied from 4.19\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u201310 to 1.18\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u20139\u00a0m2/s. The highest value Eu, EUR, and exergy loss and exergy efficiency were calculated 0.0694\u00a0kJ/s, 0.882, 0.044\u00a0kJ/s, and 0.879, respectively. Midilli et al. model, ANNs, and ANFIS model, with a determination coefficient (R2) of .9992, .9993, and .9997, provided the best performance for predicting the moisture ratio of quince fruit. Also, the ANFIS model, in comparison with the artificial neural networks model, was better able to predict Eu, EUR, exergy efficiency, and exergy loss, with R2 of .9989, .9988, .9986, and .9978, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Abstract This study presented both the empirical and artificial neural network (ANN) approaches to estimate the moisture content of Mentha spicata. Two different types of drying methods (in shade and in oven (35 and 50\u00b0C)) were used to investigate the drying kinetics of the Mentha spicata samples. The effects of drying methods on effective diffusion coefficient, moisture ratio (MR), drying rate, and activation energy were investigated. Moreover, six different thin layer drying models (Page, Diffusion approach, Newton, Modified Henderson, Henderson and Pabis and Pabis and Midilli) and an ANN with feed forward structure were used to define the drying kinetics of these samples. In order to estimate the kinetic model parameters, sequential quadratic programming (SQP) was used. Model performances were evaluated based on the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE\\%) values. In the kinetic part of the modeling study, the Midilli model provided better results than the others. However, the ANN had the best results when a total assessment was made. The effective diffusion coefficient values were found in the range between 1.31\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u201312 and 4.43\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u201312 m2/s. The activation energy was obtained as 44.31\u00a0kJ/kmol. The R2, MAPE\\%, and RMSE values for the ANN test data were 1.00, 0.2257, and 5.9447\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124, respectively. In the future, different modeling approaches will be applied to describe this drying process. Practical applications Drying is a process where heat transfer and mass transfer take place together. Modeling is an innovative approach used in evaluation of experimental data and has increasing popularity in recent years. ANNs are a powerful data-driven method, and they have a very broad area of usage from medicine to engineering issues. Empirical models are another approach for describing experimental data. In this study, these two modeling approaches were used to obtain the MR. Humidity is a condition that needs to be checked in food safety and protection. Therefore, it is very important to ensure control with robust modeling techniques. In this study, the developed ANN model had a high R2 value (R2",

Genetic Algorithm was used in order to find the best Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN) structure for modeling and estimation of moisture content in the drying process of savory leaves. The experiments were performed at three air temperatures of 40, 60 and 80\u202f\u00b0C and at three levels of relative humidity 20%, 30% and 40% and air velocity of 1, 1.5 and 2.0\u202fm/s for drying the savory leaves in the forced conductive dryer. Optimized neural network by GA had two hidden layers with 9 and 17 neurons in first and second hidden layers, respectively. Mean Square Error (MSE) value (0.000094606) and correlation coefficient (0.9992) of FFNN-GA experiments showed that moisture content can be accurately predicted from the input variables: air temperature, airflow velocity, relative humidity and drying time. Moreover, results showed that the optimized neural network topology could denote the superior ability of this intelligent model for on-line prediction of the moisture content of Savory leaves in different drying conditions.",

        "abstract": "Mapping the drying characteristics of biological products is essential for drying time estimation and reduction of energy consumption. The knowledge of mass transfer parameters during different drying conditions is required for process and equipment design and is of great industrial importance. In this work, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach was adopted to model the vacuum drying kinetics of moringa leaves. Levenberg\u2013Marquardt\u2019s training algorithm with LOGSIGMOID and TANSIGMOID hidden layer transfer functions gave superior results for the prediction of moisture content and moisture ratio, respectively. Further, a comparative evaluation of the predictive capability of ANN and 7 different semi-empirical models was performed. The Page model was found suitable to fit the experimental data with a R2 comparable to that of ANN. However, the MSE observed for ANN (1.05\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22126) was significantly lower than that of Page model (2.56\u2009\u00d7\u200910-6 to 5.81\u2009\u00d7\u200910-4). Effective moisture diffusivity and mass transfer coefficient increased with increase in temperature from 0.71\u2009\u00d7\u200910-9 to 1.91\u2009\u00d7\u200910-9 \u2009m2/s and, 1.07\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7 to 4.07\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7 m/s, respectively. Activation energy for drying of moringa leaves was calculated as 42.84\u2009kJ/mol which showed moderate energy requirements for moisture diffusion. Specific energy consumed was directly affected by drying time and varied from 6.07 to 22.26\u2009kW\u2009h/kg. Drying temperature of 60\u2009\u00b0C resulted in higher drying rate, lower drying time and energy consumption and therefore, recommended for drying of Moringa olifera leaves.",

The effects of surface temperature of the fruits and relative humidity just above their surface on the constants and coefficients of the selected models were also studied by multiple regression analysis. In studying the consistency of all the models, some statistical tests, such as \u03c72, MBE and RMSE were also used as well as correlation coefficients.
